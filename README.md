## üéØ Purpose of the Project

With more cases piling up in the country, experts have appealed to people to get themselves vaccinated at the earliest. The studies have shown that even people, who have received just one jab can have enough immunity to endure Covid-19 and there there is less risk of getting into a serious condition.

However, the state-run Co-WIN website, which offers people to get appointments for vaccination at  the nearest health centres, is inundated with millions of requests. This has caused the website to crash and sometimes show an error message.

The application will help user check the availability of vaccination slots for a specific date by individually entering different PIN codes or district details along with the age group (18+ or 45+). If there are no slots available, users can subscribe to email alert service to get notification as soon as slots are avaialble in there area.

The data is sourced on a real-time basis from the CoWIN API, which is the official government platform to book slots for vaccination.
